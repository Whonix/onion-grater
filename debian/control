Description: Whitelisting filter for dangerous Tor control protocol commands
 Filters out Tor control protocol commands that are dangerous for anonymity
 such as GETINFO ADDRESS using a whitelist. Acts as a proxy between the client
 application and Tor.
 .
 For example it allows using Tor Browser's New Identity feature on Anonymity
 Distribution Workstations, fixes Tor Browser's about:tor default homepage and
 Tor Button status indicator without exposing commands that are dangerous for
 anonymity.
 .
 This package is supposed to be installed on Anonymity Distributions.
 .
 It seamlessly integrates if the anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor package
 is installed on a Anonymity Distribution Workstations. For example it then
 allows running a unmodified Tor Browser Bundle from The Tor Project without
 Tor over Tor and with functional New Identity and about:tor.
 .
 This control port filter is written in Python. The original Python code
 was forked from the Tails version of control port filter.
 .
 This package is produced independently of, and carries no guarantee from,
 The Tor Project.
